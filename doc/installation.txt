CORE:

1) Patch the kernel and compile it with Clondike support (currently version 2.6.23)
 Do not forget to compile in 9P file system!
2) Create clondike user (999)
3) Create as root /home/clondike, /clondike, /mnt/proxy & /mnt/clondike
4) Create subdirs of /mnt/clondike (UGLY, this shall be solved some better way)
 Now, it is necessary to create subdirs in format:
/mnt/clondike/IP-UID-GID
 Where IP is ip of remote node that can be used as a detached node by this machnie. UID and GID are user id and group id combinations that can be used.
 So, an example would be:
/mnt/clondike/192.168.1.155-0-0 ... it measn we can use 192.168.1.155 as a detached node and only "root" can do it at the moment
... this must change hopefully soon, but it has not yet!!
5) Compile clondike (against the patched kernel)
6) Edit listen file to bind to local ip (TODO: Improve this, detect local ip if there is only one)
7) Install NPFS, user-space server for plan 9 file system!

USER SPACE:

1) Go to userspace/director-api and "make" it
2) Go to userspace/ruby-director-api and "make" it
3) Copy resulting lib into "userspace/simple-ruby-director"
