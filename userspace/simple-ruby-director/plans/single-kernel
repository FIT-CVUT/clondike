#Example of format for writing test plans.

# Specifies how many nodes will participate in the measurements. There must be enough nodes in a cluster
Nodes count: 
  3

# List of all tasks that will be referred later. Format is:
# <UNIQUE_TASK_NAME>: exec "<COMMAND>" <PATH_WHERE_TO_EXECUTE>
Tasks:
  makekernel: exec "make -j 15" /usr/src/linux-2.6.33.1

# Finally, section what, when and where to execute. Format is:
#  <EXECUTION_NODE_NAME>: <NAME_OF_TASK_TO_EXECUTE> <OPTIONAL_DELAY_IN_SECONDS_WHEN_TO_START_THE_MEASUREMENT>
# EXECUTION_NODE_NAME could be:
#  LocalNode .. execute locally
#  RemoteNodeX .. where X is number from 1 to nodes_count - 1.. this specifies one of the remote nodes. It is not generally specified which not it is, but the identifier remains stable throughout all test
#  ALL .. execute on all nodes
#  Multiple names separated via comma
Nodes: 
  LocalNode: makekernel
