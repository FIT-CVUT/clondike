 * Loads and resotres task's pwd. It is assumed the task is already chrooted in its new root if required.

 * There are 3 basic cases:
 *   1) (PEN) Migrated processes are running chrooted into the distributed file system
 *   2) (PEN) Migrated processes are running in standard PEN fs and for shared files a distributed filesystem is used. Only file in this filesystem may be used by the process
 *   3) (CCN) Process is migrated back to its UHN and it has to open real files in the fs (or files in distributed filesystem if option 2 is used)
 *   
 * Option 1) does not need any pwdmnt resolution as it is equal to new process current dir. Options 2&3 need resolution of pwdmnt by pwd path. We do the resolution in all 3 options
 * for simplicity.
