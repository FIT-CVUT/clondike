/** @defgroup tcmi_ctlfs_entry_class tcmi_ctlfs_entry class 
 * 
 * @ingroup tcmi_ctlfs_class
 *
 * This class represents a generic entry in the tcmi control file system.
 * No instances of this class can be made. The goal is to provide generic
 * functionality that can be used by specific file system entries:
 * - Initialization/deletion/freeing of instances.
 * - Instance reference counting - this is needed as we expect
 * multiple threads of execution to access one entry at a time. This
 * ensures no memory leaks will occur. The reference counting is not
 * implemented from scratch. Each entry is associated with a VFS
 * dentry. These are VFS objects that already have a reference
 * counter. Each instance registers with VFS and receives a
 * notification when the reference counter reaches 0
 * (tcmi_ctlfs_dentry_release()) and the associated dentry is to be
 * freed. This approach provides a safe access to the entry instances
 * from multiple threads of execution without writing an extra
 * reference couting code.  
 * - entry location methods - a generic method that iterates through
 * all predecessors of an entry is provided. This is used when
 * determining the depth of the entry in the filesystem tree.
