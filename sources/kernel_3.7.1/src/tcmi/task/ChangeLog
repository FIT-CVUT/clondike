	* tcmi_taskhelper.h (tcmi_taskhelper_flushfiles): Added method
	that flushes and closes all regular files that the current process
	has open.

	* tcmi_guesttask.c (tcmi_guesttask_migrateback_ppm_p):Before
	sending the migration message, all regular files and directories
	are flushed(closed).
	
	* tcmi_shadowtask.c (tcmi_shadowtask_emigrate_ppm_p): Before
	sending the migration message, all regular files and directories
	are flushed (closed).
	
	* tcmi_shadowtask.c (tcmi_shadowtask_execve): This method finishes
	merging of the shadow with the original process - schedules an
	exit that dettaches TCMI task from the running process.
	

	* tcmi_task.c (tcmi_task_execve): Prior to issueing the actual
	execve, the particular instance is notified. This is need by
	shadow tasks when merging with a process migrating home.

	* tcmi_task.c (tcmi_task_prepare_execve): Fixed an issue, the old
	execve context is now always being released upon preparing a new
	one.
