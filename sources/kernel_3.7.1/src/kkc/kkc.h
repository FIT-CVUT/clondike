/** @defgroup kkc_class KKC
 *
 * KKC is a \<\<singleton\>\> class that provides interkernel
 * communication facility. KKC sockets are used as an abstraction of
 * a connection. This component ensures loading architecture specific
 * modules via \link kkc_arch_class kkc_arch \endlink. 
 *
 * The communication features can be divided into two groups: 
 *
 * -# Socket creation and connecting to the destination or listening
 * on a specified interface. This is handled by connect/listen
 * operations as follows: Based on the string specified by the user
 * (e.g. tcp:192.168.0.1:2000), it gets the instance of the particular
 * architecture (tcp in this case) and delegates the work to the
 * particular architecture to instantiate the socket. Then, the new socket
 * is asked to setup a connection or listening.
 * -# Regular socket operations - to send/receive data, disconnect,
 * append/remove a process to the socket waitqueue. These operations
 * are KKC socket methods and this class provides only aliases.
