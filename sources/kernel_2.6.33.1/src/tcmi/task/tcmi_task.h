 *
 * TCMI task is an abstraction for any process in the system that
 * participates in migration. This \<\<template\>\> class gathers
 * common functionality for shadow tasks that represent a migrated
 * process on CCN as well as for guest tasks that represent the
 * migrated process on PEN.
 *
 * TCMI tasks are controlled from user space via migration component.
 * Each task is associated with its migration manager. This ensures
 * that all messages addressed to a particular task are also delivered
 * to its message queue or transactions slotvector.  A TCMI task is
 * given a communication socket (KKC socket) upon its
 * instantiation. It is the communication channel that it will use for
 * sending messages out.  Note, that message delivery is handled
 * exclusively by the migration manager. This makes it very easy to
 * move a task among TCMI migration managers.
 *
 * The main purpose of this class is execution of methods in the context
 * of the shadow and guest process resp. These methods are submitted by the
 * migration component into the method queue and include:
 * - request to migrate a process to a PEN - includes PPM_P, PPM_V, NPM
 * - request to migrate a process back to CCN - includes PPM_P, PPM_V, NPM
 * - request to process any incoming TCMI messages from the message queue.
 * - request to terminate
 *
 * Methods in the queue are processed via a 'method pump'. Each method
 * returns a status that is used by the controlling component to make
 * a decision what to do further. Status return codes have following
 * meanings:
 *
 * - KEEP_PUMPING - the method pump should keep going as long as there
 * are methods to process
 *
 * - MOVE_ME - stop pumping and tell the task controlling component to
 * move it to a different migration manager (relevant for shadow tasks
 * on CCN)
 *
 * - EXECVE_FAILED_KILL_ME - stop pumping and tell the task
 * controlling component to kill this task. This status denotes the
 * situation when the task tried issuing execve(typically when loading
 * a new checkpoint or processing a non-preemptive migration request)
 * and it failed. This status is needed as it also instructs the method
 * pump not to discard the method wrapper as it has already been done
 * by (tcmi_task_execve() method internally)
 * 
 * - KILL_ME - stop pumping and tell the task controlling component to
 * kill this task (issue do_exit()) and remove it from its migration
 * manager
 *
 * - LET_ME_GO -stop pumping and tell the task controlling component
 * leave the migration mode, leave the task as is.
 *
 * - REMOVE_AND_LET_ME_GO -stop pumping and tell the task controlling
 * component to remove the task from its current migration manager,
 * destroy the tcmi_task and and let the regular task go. For example,
 * this status is returned by task_exit() method as it is called from
 * the intercepted exit system call. Once the TCMI task is detached
 * from its process the exit system call resumes and performs the
 * actual exit.
 *
 * In addition, the task also holds the filename along with argv and
 * envp arrays that will be executed. It is important to keep track of
 * this data as they are required by the execve (e.g. when migrating a
 * a task by executing it's checkpoint image). These resources
 * eventually need to be released once the execve has been issued or
 * when the task is destroyed. There is functionality that makes arguments
 * and environment management easy.
 *
 * Abbreviations:
 * - PPM_P - preemptive process migration using physical checkpoint image
 * - PPM_V - preemptive process migration using virtual checkpoint image
 * - NPM - non-preemptive process migration (using execve hook)
