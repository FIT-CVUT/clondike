	* tcmi_module.c: removed task reap file. It is not needed anymore,
	the shadow task after merging with a process migrating home
	destroys itself automaticall.

	* tcmi_module.c (tcmi_module_init): Added checks for successful
	CCN/PEN initialization.  Removed #ifdef CONFIG_TCMI_*, the
	framework configuration is now internally handled by CCN/PEN
	managers. Module initialization thus always requests init of CCN
	and PEN. The subsystem that is not compiled has no effect.
