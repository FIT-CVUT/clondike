#Clondike#

**Clondike is a Peer-to-Peer Linux non-dedicated cluster for sharing computing power.** Clondike stands for CLuster Of Non-Dedicated Interoperating
KErnels.

If you have some really cool multi-proccessing and (or) multi-threaded application, **the Clondike will help you to run this application parallel on multiple computers without any edit the code!** The Clondike can migrate the threads and the proccesses to other clondike-installed computers. The Clondike maintains the threads/procceses cooperation like as shared memory, semaphores and shared files.

## How to install ##

Full details about the build process can be found in the [Clondike install instructions](https://github.com/FIT-CVUT/clondike/blob/master/doc/install_manual_clondike-en.desc).

Soon we will have here an automatic generated run-able image of the Clondike for your easy tryout.
