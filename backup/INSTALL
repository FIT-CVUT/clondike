Intallation
============
Requirements:
 - clondike sources
 - linux kernel >= 2.6.10
 - gcc >= 2.96
 - patch 
 - make 

Required libs:
 - For secure connections between remote peers Clondike can automatically use OpenVPN. It must be compiled with support enabling password storing.

Assumptions:
 - linux sources are in /usr/src/linux
 - clondike.tar.gz has been copied to your home (e.g. /home/capekj)


Installation steps:
-----------------
 - Untar the sources
 tar xvzf clondike.tar.gz

 - Patch the kernel 
 cd /usr/src/linux
 pfile=/home/capekj/clondike/patch/linux-2.6.11.8-clondike-patch
 patch -p1 --dry-run $pfile && patch -p1 $pfile
 
 As we can see it is a two stage process where the patch is first tested
 against the kernel.

 - Configure the kernel
 make menuconfig

 In the main configuration screen there is a new item - clondike. Expand
 the menu and select:
 'enable TCMI' -> general support of TCMI in kernel
 
 When enabled there are two options how the cluster node will be setup:
 - CCN (cluster core node)
 - PEN (process execution node)
 
 Both options can be selected at the same time. The node will be able
 to act as CCN as well as PEN.

 - compile the kernel
 make
 su
 make install
 make modules_install

 - reboot with the new kernel

 - compile clondike 
 cd /home/capekj/clondike
 make
 su
 make install

 You will get warnings about unresolved symbols during
 compilation. These come from Kbuild(not gcc) as it can't
 find them in the system.map. Clondike is compiled as a set of
 external modules and some clondike modules (e.g. tcmi_module.ko) use
 other clondike modules. Those symbols can't be obviously present in
 system.map.

 Installation process creates a new user(clondike, uid=999) and
 mountpoint for tcmi_ctlfs at /clondike


Loading clondike:
-----------------
 - load the framework:
 cd /home/capekj/clondike/scripts
 ./load.sh

 There should be a directory structure similar to this visible in /clondike:
 /clondike/ccn/listen
 /clondike/ccn/stop-listen-one
 /clondike/ccn/stop-listen-all
 /clondike/ccn/stop
 /clondike/ccn/listening-on 
 /clondike/ccn/mig/migrate-home
 /clondike/ccn/mig/emigrate-ppm-p
 /clondike/ccn/mig/migproc
 /clondike/ccn/nodes

 This is for a node configured as CCN. PEN would have a similar layout but in 
 /clondike/pen directory.
